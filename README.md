# self-tracker
Self Tracker is my personal data app that displays self metrics such as sleep and activity. This app leverages Python and libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Streamlit, and more to pull data from an api, clean the data, upload the data to Big Query, and pull data into my web interface data app.
